1.0.2
    Added fixes, comments for each of 7 bugs found from Coverity scan #1.
	Note that some "bugs" were ignored, though the comments reflect the decision.

1.0.1
    Added comments for tcpAddr and tcpPort in fmtpRecvv3.h per Malathi's request. 
        These are the sender-side IP address and TCP port number to which a receiver should connect. 
        Since the TCP connection used by FMTP is over the multipoint VLAN, 
        the IP address is the private IP address at the sender for the VLAN. 

1.0.0
    Initial release.
    Add Ryan to Github repository as contributor.
