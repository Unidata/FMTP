INTRODUCTION
------------

VCMTPv3 is the third version of the reliable multicast transportation protocol
developed by University of Virginia. Currently, this protocol is running in
the user space as an application protocol. And underneath it's calling the
standard TCP/UDP and IP protocol stack. This protocol is consisted of two major
parts: the sending side and the receiving side. In a typical scenario, there
should be one sender and multiple receivers in a multicast group. The sender
runs the sending side protocol and sends out the data via multicast. Those
receivers will run the receiving side protocol to receive the data. If losses
happen, the receiver can request for retransmission via a TCP connection from
the receiver to the sender. And sender will determine either to respond to the
request or to reject it.




SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
-------------------

VCMTPv3 is developed and tested on Linux/UNIX. All the mainstream distributions
such as Ubuntu LTS 12.04 or above, CentOS 5 or above, Mac OSX 10.9 or above
and FreeBSD 9 or above will be supported. Microsoft Windows is not supported.

Recommended hardware for running this protocol would be:
Duo core CPU or higher
1GB memory or higher
10GB hard drive or higher




INSTALLATION
------------

Before actually start to compile and install the protocol. Make sure the listed
pre-requisites have been met. All of the following instructions will be given
based on CentOS 6.6 x86_64.
Git
$ sudo yum install git
