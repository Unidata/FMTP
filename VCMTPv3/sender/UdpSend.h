 * @brief     Define the interfaces and structures of sender side UDP layer
 *            abstracted funtions.
 *
 * The UdpSend class includes a set of transmission functions, which are
 * basically the encapsulation of udp system calls themselves. This abstracted
 * new layer acts as the sender side transmission library.
