 * @brief     conditional variable: wait_for usage demo.
 *
 * This is a simple demo to show how to use conditional variable and its
 * wait_for method. In this test, two threads are used, one for timer and
 * another for caller. Timer would either sleep for enough time or being
 * interrupted by the caller using a conditional variable.
